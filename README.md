# TimeZone-Data
Created a user interface that displays a location's time zone based on the user's current location and the address they provide via input.


The task is to create a user interface that displays a location's time zone based on the user's current location and the address they provide. The following steps should be taken to accomplish this task:

1) Use the API documentation provided by geoapify.com to retrieve time zone information based on latitude and longitude coordinates. The API documentation can be found here: https://www.geoapify.com/get-timezone-from-lat-long-geographical-coordinates

2)Create a user interface as shown in the Figma design located at the following link: https://www.figma.com/file/CSwRxPkdiFzE0H9hqbZiOm/Untitled?node-id=0%3A1&t=PGLrcIv4Ch80kUit-1

3)When the user first loads the webpage, use the HTML5 Geolocation API https://www.w3schools.com/html/html5_geolocation.asp to automatically detect the user's current location and display their current time zone.

4)Provide a text input field that allows the user to enter an address and a button that, when clicked, uses the address to retrieve the time zone of that location and display it on the page. If the time zone cannot be found, display an error message that states, "Time zone could not be found."


The marking scheme for the above question is a breakdown of the different tasks and their corresponding point values.
1 . Creating the user interface (UI) shown in the provided Figma design.

2 . Using the HTML5 Geolocation API to detect the user's current location on page load automatically.

3 . Retrieving the time zone using the latitude and longitude coordinates.

4 . Retrieving the time zone using an address provided by the user.
